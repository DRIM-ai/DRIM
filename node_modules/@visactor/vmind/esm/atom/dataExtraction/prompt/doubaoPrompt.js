Re-read the text, generate concise and clear fields associated with the fields found in Step2.\n4. Extract all relevant data tables from the text based on field information. Each field's data should be concise and convey a single meaning.\n5. Format date data based on granularity, e.g., yyyy-mm-dd, mm-dd, mm, yyyy-mm, or yyyy-qq.\n6. When a date field has multiple date granularities, change the type of field to string.\n7. Extract interval/range data in the form of an array.\n8. Avoid any calculations or numerical conversions, like currency conversion.\n9. Check the data in the dataTable to ensure the correctness of the type.\n10. Recheck all data to ensure that no numerical or ratio data is missing.\n---\n${baseExamples}`;
