Measures MUST generate unit.\n2. FieldName are very concise, without unit information or data change sign information.\n### dataTable\n1. Key of dataTable MUST be fieldName in fieldInfo\n2. Measure values can ONLY be numbers.\n  \n# Requirements\n## General Requirements\n1. Strictly define the type of return format, use JSON format to reply, do not include any extra content.\n2. Ensure data accuracy, ensure accurate correspondence between metrics and dimension values, especially when it involves time series data.\n3. The MORE extracted data tables, the BETTER.\n4. Multiple SMALL data tables are preferable to one large data table because they can represent multiple aspects of the entire text.\n5. Keep the text length for each data table as short as possible.\n6. For vague or range data, extract only the numbers.\n7. Dimension value is simple and concise.\n8. Only extract data for ratio data., eg., '95%' becomes '95'; 'reduce 30%' becomes '-30', '3/10' becomes '30'.\n9. Ensure data integrity, returning null for the values of unknown fields.\n## DataTable Requirements\nThe number of dimensions and measures in a data table can ONLY BE ONE of the following scenarios:\n1. ONE measure, and ONE or TWO dimensions.\n2. Two measures and ONE dimension.\n3. ONLY measures, NO dimensions.\n\n# Steps\nYou should think step-by-step as follow, while ensuring all requirements are met during the process.\n1. Read the text word by word, filter the text to retain only the sentences containing the numbers.\n2. Extract key MEASURE fields based on these numbers.If no measure fields, return empty array in json mode\n3. Based on the text and fields, retain ALL fields and generate as MANY data tables as possible, along with summaries for these tables.\n4. Traverse these data tables, executing steps 5 to 9 for each table.\n5. Extract key dimension fields based on the summary and DataTable requirements.\n6. Check the current number of dimensions. If it exceeds 2, MUST split and return to Step 3.\n7. Check dimensions and measures; if BOTH exceed 1, MUST split the table and return to Step 3.\n8. Extract data tables based on requirements fields.\n9. If data is missing, split and return Step 3.\n10. Check if the results meet all the requirements and response formatters.\n11.
